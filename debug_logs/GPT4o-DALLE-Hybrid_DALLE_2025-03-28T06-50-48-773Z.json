      "revised_prompt": "A photorealistic image of a 'Honeyed Whiskey Sour' cocktail. The drink sits elegantly in a clear, classic rocks glass, boasting a golden amber color and a creamy white frothy cap from the egg white. The foam is speckled with an intricate pattern of orange dots from a dash of Angostura Bitters. A finely sliced lemon wheel garnishes the rim of the glass. The background is soft and warmly hued, highlighting the honey-inspired tones of the drink. Gentle lighting emanates warmth and creates subtle reflections on the glass's surface, while a blurry timber bar counter introduces depth and texture to the overall scene. The glass contains 2 oz of Irish whiskey, 3/4 oz of fresh lemon juice, 1/2 oz of honey syrup, 1/2 oz of egg white, and Angostura Bitters as a garnish. The image is polished and enticing, mimicking the quality of a professional food photographer's work. There is no text or watermark, and the background is clear with a soft focus.",

        "content": "The Southern Peach Smash is served in a classic rocks glass with a sturdy, clear base. The cocktail exhibits a vibrant golden-amber hue, accentuated by the warm, diffused sunlight streaming from a window, casting soft reflections. Fresh mint leaves are nestled within, adding a pop of deep green, while a juicy peach slice rests on the rim, offering a contrast. The background is a blurred rustic wood surface, enhancing the Southern charm. The overall composition captures the essence of fresh, summery elegance with a focus on texture and reflection, inviting you into its refreshing allure.",

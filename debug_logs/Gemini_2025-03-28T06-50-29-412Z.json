            "text": "I can't create a photorealistic image as I'm a text-based AI. However, I can give you a highly detailed description of how such a photograph might look, which you could use as a guide for creating the image yourself or commissioning one from an artist:\n\n**Setting:**\n\n* **Background:** Dark, possibly a slate or dark wood surface to create contrast and richness. A few scattered, dimly lit whiskey barrels in the far background could add depth and context.\n* **Lighting:**  Low-key lighting with a single, focused light source slightly above and to the left of the glass, highlighting the amber liquid and the smoke.  A subtle backlight could rim the glass and ice, adding further drama.\n\n**Glassware:**\n\n* A classic Old Fashioned glass (rocks glass) â€“ short and wide, made of clear, heavy glass.  It should be about 2/3 full.  The glass should appear cool to the touch, perhaps with a slight condensation.\n\n**Cocktail:**\n\n* **Ice:** A single large, perfectly clear ice cube,  slightly melting, sits nestled in the glass. Its surface reflects the ambient light and the amber hues of the whiskey.\n* **Liquid:**  The rye whiskey forms a rich, amber pool around the ice. Its surface is smooth, undisturbed except for the subtle swirling patterns left by the stirring. The color is deep and inviting, suggesting the warmth of the alcohol.\n* **Smoke:** A wisp of delicate, bluish-white smoke curls upwards from the surface of the drink, catching the light and adding a mysterious, aromatic element to the scene. This smoke could be generated by briefly smoking the glass with wood chips (like hickory or applewood, complementing the maple) before building the cocktail.\n\n**Garnish:**\n\n* **Orange Peel:** A wide, elegantly expressed orange peel rests against the ice cube, its vibrant orange color a stark contrast against the darker tones of the whiskey.  Small droplets of orange oil glisten on the surface of the peel, showcasing its freshness. A small part of the peel might be dipped into the drink, adding a further touch of color.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe overall image should exude a sense of warmth, sophistication, and handcrafted quality.  The focus should be on the cocktail, highlighting its rich color, the textures of the ice and orange peel, and the ethereal quality of the smoke.  The lighting, composition, and attention to detail should create a visually stunning and mouthwatering image that makes the viewer crave a sip.\n\n\nThis description provides a starting point for visualizing your perfect \"Smoky Maple Old Fashioned\" cocktail photo.  Remember to experiment with different angles, lighting setups, and garnishes to achieve the desired effect.\n"
